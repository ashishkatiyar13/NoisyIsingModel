The IPython notebook has the implementation to learn the equivalence class from noisy samples of tree structured Ising Models.

Platform:

Python 3.5

Packages required:

numpy
scipy
time

Execution:

To reproduce the results for various settings mentioned in the paper, 
the parameters can be set in the init_params() function.

The tree can be star-shaped or chain-shaped and is specified in the 'shape' parameter.

The code is run by executing the main() function.
